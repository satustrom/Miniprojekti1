# Miniprojekti1

This is an application using real time train traffic information from Finnish Transportation Agency's open data service Digitraffic. The application provides a text-based user interface for searching train information. You can search information by train number or by station (all departing trains from a specific station, or all trains running between two stations). You can also search a specific train's geographical location by coordinates or location by which stations it has passed if it's currently running. The application covers both long-distance trains and commuter trains. 

This was a group project for an accelerated learning program in Java, accomplished by a group of four people in three days, with three weeks of teaching behind us.
